## A Different Kind of Challenge

TOUCHIT wasn't my typical client. This major Slovak technology news portal needed more than just technical SEO improvements and web performance fixes. They wanted me to **lead the technical aspects of their complete website redesign**.

For one of the country's largest technology news portals, every line of code must be perfectly efficient. Under heavy traffic, even small inefficiencies can cause the entire system to collapse like a house of cards.

This project let me leverage my years of web development experience in a new way. I supervised the third-party contractor and reviewed every piece of code they delivered. This hands-on approach allowed me to implement **technical SEO and web performance best practices from day one**.

## Starting with the Foundation

I knew I had to consider SEO and performance requirements during the design phase. Waiting until after development would mean costly changes and compromises.

From the first day of my collaboration, I worked closely with the design team to ensure their vision aligned with technical requirements. Major design decisions had to support performance goals. This early integration saved countless hours and prevented significant revisions later.

## The Transformation from 43% to 93% Success Rate

My primary goal was clear. Dramatically improve web performance while managing the redesign and migration. The results speak for themselves.

**I transformed their Core Web Vitals pass rate from 43% to 93% of all visitors.**

The most critical issue was their Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) metric. Since Time to First Byte (TTFB) is a crucial component of LCP, their extremely high TTFB was destroying overall performance. We tackled this systematically, rewriting the majority of the codebase and upgrading their infrastructure.

The improvement graph tells the story perfectly. You can see the dramatic shift between the old site's performance and the new redesigned version's success.

While some countries still show lower scores, this doesn't affect the client. The portal serves Slovak content to Slovak visitors.

The second graph captures the two weeks following migration. You can notice some fluctuations in the "Needs Improvement" category. These occurred while I fine-tuned the CDN settings, but the overall trend remained strongly positive.

## The Business Impact: Dramatic Engagement Improvements

Web performance improvements delivered immediate, measurable business results through two key metrics.

### Bounce Rate

Before migration, the bounce rate hovered around **83%**. Just one day after launching the new site, it dropped below **35%**. Today, it remains steady at approximately **27%**.

This massive reduction came directly from improvements in TTFB and LCP. Visitors now stay because pages load almost instantly.

### Page Views Per Session

For a technology news portal monetized through advertising, page views directly impact revenue. The transformation here was remarkable.

Before migration, average visitors viewed only **1.3 pages per session**. Immediately after launch, this jumped to **3.1 pages**. While initial excitement about the new design inflated this number, it has now stabilized at **2.3 pages per session**.

That represents an **80% increase in page views per visit**. For an ad-supported business, this improvement transforms their revenue potential.

## Technical Excellence Drives Business Success

This project proves once again that technical foundations matter. My comprehensive approach to technical SEO and web performance has helped touchit.sk maintain their position among Slovakia's most popular technology portals.

Recent months have brought challenges. AI Overview and other search engine changes have impacted organic traffic across the industry. However, technical improvements continue to deliver value. Visitors stay longer on the site, engagement metrics remain strong, and organic traffic has stabilized despite industry-wide declines.

The lesson is clear. When you build on a rock-solid technical foundation, your site can weather any storm. For touchit.sk, investing in performance and technical excellence wasn't just about better metrics. It was about securing their future in an increasingly competitive digital landscape.
